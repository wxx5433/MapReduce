We are the leaders of tomorrow
We are the ones to have the fun
We want control, we want the power
Not gonna stop until it comes
We are not Jesus Christ
We are not fascist pigs
We are not capitalist industrialists
We are not communists, we are the one
We will build a better tomorrow
The youth of today will be the tool
American children made for survival
Fate and our destiny we shall rule
We are not Jesus Christ
We are not fascist pigs
We are not capitalist industrialists
We are not communists, we are the one
I am the one who brings you the future
I am the one who buries the past
A new species rises up from the ruins
I am the one who is made to last
